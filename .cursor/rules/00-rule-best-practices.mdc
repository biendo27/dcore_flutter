# Cursor Rule Best Practices

## Core Principles
- Keep rules **focused**, **actionable**, and **scoped**
- Prioritize concise content (aim for under 500 lines)
- Split large concepts into multiple composable rules
- Include concrete examples or file references when helpful

## Structure Guidelines
- Use clear sections with hierarchical headings
- Start with a clear description of the rule's purpose
- Include code examples when demonstrating patterns
- Reference actual project files using `[filename](mdc:filename)` syntax

## Content Guidelines
- Avoid vague guidance - be specific and concrete
- Write in the style of a clear internal document
- Focus on information that helps with practical tasks
- Reuse rules when you find yourself repeating prompts in chat

## Example Rule Structure
```
# Component Architecture

## Core Principles
- List key architectural principles

## Implementation Pattern
- Show pattern with code example

## Related Files
- [example.dart](mdc:lib/example.dart) - Example implementation
```

## When to Create New Rules
- When encountering repetitive explanations or guidance
- For complex architectural patterns that need clarity
- To document project-specific conventions
- For complex workflows that are performed regularly

Remember that good rules help the AI assistant understand your codebase's organization, patterns, and conventions, resulting in more accurate and helpful assistance.
